        <h2>Quote</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Pokémon White Version 2 is far more than a traditional mid-generation release, with enough new and repurposed content to keep you occupied for months on end. It offers an addicting, expertly crafted and glorious realization of turn-based role-playing at its best, and functions as the most complete and balanced Pokémon game yet, as well as the full realization of what a 2D Pokémon adventure should look, feel and play like. If you played Black or White - get this game. It's an even more refined version of that already excellent experience, with more than enough "new" to set itself apart. If you're seeking a deep, portable RPG, regardless of whether you’ve ever thrown a Poké ball in your life - get this game, as it’s one of the crown jewels of the genre on the DS hardware. And finally, if you've played Pokémon before and want to experience the richest experience the series has to offer - look no further than Pokémon White 2. - <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/04/pokemon-white-version-2-review">https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/04/pokemon-white-version-2-review</a>
