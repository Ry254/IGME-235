        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Dig Dug</strong> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way
            through the earth.
            Stopping you from doing this are two <em>monsters</em>, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase
            you around.
            The only weapon that you carry is an <em>air pump</em>, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the
            point where they <strong>explode</strong>. [...]
