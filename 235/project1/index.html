                        Created with a team of three others using Unity for Scream Jam 2025 on itch. A horror driving simulator where you must drive a truck forward while keeping the refrigerator from overheating. Your pasanger, Jerome, will occasionaly appear to try and stop you. Pay him no mind.

                        I worked as the main 3D artist and designer as well as the general project manager. I made use of Maya, Substance Painter, and Unity for modeling, rigging, and texturing the various 3D models found through the van. As project manager I incorperated an agile style of project management into our workflow and meetings.

                        Developed a Dungeon Crawler Roguelike in MonoGame with a team of two others for a class project. You play as a dwarf going through proceduraly generated dungeons batteling monsters and trying to reach the daily quota. After reaching the quota and escaping, you get to buy items at the shop before going back in, now with stronger enemies, and a larger quota.

                    <p>
                        I was the level designer, focusing on creating the procedural generation and scaling enemies, treasure, and quota. One requirement of the project was to create an external tool that would help with the creation of the game. I used Windows Forms to create a tool that would create external files for the dungeon floors and rooms that were used in generation.
