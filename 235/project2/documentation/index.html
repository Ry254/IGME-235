        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3><a href="Project 2 - Proposal.pdf">Proposal</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Used Google Slides to create a mockup and used PokeAPI to see how it works and is structured
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><a href="prototype/">Prototype</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Compleated the catching section as that is the core functionality. Pokedex was functional, with some
                    of the filters created. Favorites was not done as catching and the Pokedex was more important for
                    the prototype. Simple CSS was applied to give some idea of the final site.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><a href="..//">Final</a></h3>
                <p>
                    More filters added for the pokedex alongside an image and name of the hovered over pokemon. Star
                    added that when clicked will favorite the pokemon displayed above the star (pokemon must be caught).
                    Favorites section shows every pokemon favorited. CSS applied to make the site look like the proposal
                    mockup. Local storage saves the previously searched filters, caught pokemon, caught shiny pokemon,
                    and favorited pokemon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One error was found durring the in-class critique, where the Crome would not have enough resources
                    while getting the images for each pokemon. I tried multiple ways to solve this, but none would work.
                    PokeAPI has no good way to get images to every form, since the url's for these images are not
                    standarized. Image IDs were sometimes different to the form IDs, and in some cases the url had the
                    form name after the ID of the default form instead. I also tried to get the images synchronously,
                    but then the site wouldn't load on my slower internet at home (but would work at school). The error
                    is still there, some functionality still works with the error. The school computers worked when
                    using Firefox.

                <h3>Functionality</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>API</h4>
                        <p>
                            Other than that error, the API data is collected and well displayed
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Local Storage</h4>
                        <p>
                            Filteres are stored along with pokemon caught, shiny pokemon caught, and favorited pokemon
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Controls</h4>
                        <p>
                            Type name to catch, caught only, shiny forms, type 1, type 2, egg group, color, shape (also
                            catch, catch random, search, and reset filters as ways to search)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Error-Free</h4>
                        <p>
                            Only the previously mentioned error that I attempted to fix. Core functionality is still
                            there.
                        </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Code</h4>
                        <p>
                            JS is fully commented and CSS has comments for each section of code. JS standards are followed
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Semantic structure</h4>
                        <p>
                            main, nav, and footer are the main three, with further structure in. Each div is used to
                            wrap simular elements for positioning and layout or to have the CSS contrast not apply to
                            the box around the pokedex images.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Valid HTML</h4>
                        <p>
                            No errors
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Valid CSS</h4>
                        <p>
                            No errors
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <h3>Look and Feel</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Visual Design</h4>
                        <p>
                            Three sections with their own colors, based on the original three english Pokemon games.
                            Nothing like the GIF Finder homework
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Interaction Design</h4>
                        <p>
                            Input are clear, told if the phrase they typed is not a valid form
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
                        <p>
                            Works well until about 400px wide and smaller heights add a scroll bar for the main section.
                            Grid is used for the main layout (nav, main, footer in a column)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                        <p>
                            Proposal submitted and prototype was demonstrated in class
                        </p>

        <h2>Other</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This was a more in depth project than if I just did a search. It's a small game
            </li>
            <li>
                debug_setAllForms() can be used in the console to set the caught, caughtShiny, and favorite attributes for
                each pokemon form to true or false
            </li>
            <li>
                debug_resetStorage() is another way to reset the storage for both keys used by the app
            </li>
