        <h1>Escape Void</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div>
            <h2>High Concept</h2>
            <p>
                It is an escape room, but you are mysteriously trapped in the void with a few doors. Solve puzzles
                and get items across the different rooms to try and find a way to escape. There will be multiple
                endings based on how, when, and if you escape.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Genre</h2>
            <p>
                This game will be a puzzle game. Requiring the player to solve a variety of puzzles to progress. Of
                course, to stay in the fashion of escape rooms, there will be red herrings and items to collect.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Platform</h2>
            <p>
                This project will focus on development for desktop, with cursor and text interactions. If time, I
                will make the project mobile friendly.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
                You awaken to see that you are trapped in some sort of void, with only a few doors there with you.
                One door is labeled “EXIT” and is locked by four keys that match the colors on the other four doors:
                red, yellow, green, and blue. It seems you must get the keys from each room to escape. The exit door
                also has a timer on it, counting down from 20 minutes. Better get started.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>
                The graphic style will consist of digitally drawn sprites for each scene and interactable object.
                Each scene will have its own main color family, except for the main void, which will have the five
                doors of different colors and a background of noise. Sound will consist of a low static and a sound
                when the player clicks an interactable object. Interactable objects will also react when hovered or
                active.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The primary actions would be in a point and click style. With the player able to click on different
                objects in the scene, as well as items in their inventory. These interactions can change the scene,
                show a description, or give a choice, depending on the object. There is also a form where the player
                can keep notes as well.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Mockups</h2>
            <div id="mockups">
                <div>
                    <img src="images/mockup_void.svg" alt="Mockup of the default void">
                    <p>
                        The starting void
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/mockup_greenSpace.svg" alt="Mockup of the green space">
                    <p>
                        The green space
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Stretch</h2>
            <p>
                Three stretch goals will be randomizing the solutions and what is needed to escape, making a
                difficulty system, and giving the project mobile support.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Other</h2>
            <p>
                I will primarily be using JavaScript and the Browser DOM for this project, but may incorporate some
                PixiJS, at least for the background noise. Since some puzzles may incorporate the color of the
                scenes, descriptions will also describe the colors of objects.
