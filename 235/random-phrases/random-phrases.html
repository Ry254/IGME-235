    <!--The page content must be legible and nicely styled, with good choices made for colors, margins and fonts-->
    <!--The page doesn't have to be fully-responsive, but should look acceptable and be legible on both desktop and phone.-->

    <!--You will have at least 5 phrases stored in a JavaScript array-->
    <!--When the page loads (or reloads) a random phrase from the array will be selected and displayed.
        You can use Math.random(), Math.floor(), and array.length to accomplish this. If you get stuck,
        look for help on the Internet. Suggestion, the function mentioned below could be called when the
        page first loads.-->
    <!--Additionally, create a nicely styled <button> and put it on the screen.
        Feel free to search the web for appropriate button CSS styles.-->
    <!--Add CSS button rules for :hover and :active so that the button has a nice "over" and "down" look.-->
    <!--Clicking the button will call a function named displayQuote, which will generate and display a random quote.-->
